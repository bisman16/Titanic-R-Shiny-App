# Titanic-R-Shiny-App
This is a Shiny application developed in R using Kaggle's Titanic dataset that predicts the fate of the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which infamously sank in the Atlantic ocean during its maiden voyage after colliding with an iceberg,  killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

# About App
This app lets you interact with the training dataset and filter the results based on sex, Passenger class, Passenger age group and survival. You can also plot a jitter or smooth X-Y plot between any two variables and use another variable (such as color) as a grouping variable.
